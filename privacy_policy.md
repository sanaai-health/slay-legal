Privacy Policy for Slay
Last updated: August 5, 2025

Our Commitment to Your Privacy
At Slay, we believe your personal data belongs to you. We've built our app with privacy at its core, ensuring your personal information remains private and secure while delivering the brutal honesty and goal-crushing motivation you need.

What We DON'T Do
• We DO NOT collect, store, or access your personal goal and habit data on any servers
• We DO NOT upload your progress information to the cloud
• We DO NOT share or sell your data with third parties
• We DO NOT track your personal metrics remotely
• We DO NOT use encryption for local storage (all data is stored in standard Hive boxes on your device)

How Your Data is Stored

Local Storage Only
All your personal information (goals, habits, progress tracking, and personal metrics) is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (Hive database). This means:

• Your data never leaves your phone
• Only you can access your personal information through the app
• If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed
• No backups are made to cloud services
• Data is stored in standard format without encryption

Authentication Data
We only collect minimal information required for app functionality:

• Email address (for authentication only)
• Subscription status (to enable premium features)
• Basic usage analytics (app crashes, performance metrics)

This data is securely managed through Firebase Authentication and is never linked to your personal goal and habit information.

AI Interactions
When you use our AI coaching features:

• Conversations are processed in real-time using Google Gemini API
• No conversation history is stored on our servers
• Image analysis is performed without retaining the images
• AI responses are generated based on your immediate query only
• Personal context is generated temporarily for each session and immediately discarded

Your Control and Responsibility
• You have complete control over your data
• You may choose to share information with others at your discretion
• We are not responsible for data you choose to share outside the app
• You can request account deletion by contacting help.sanai@gmail.com
• You can immediately delete all your data by uninstalling the app

Data Deletion
You can delete your data in two ways:

**Immediate deletion:** Uninstall the app from your device

**Account deletion:** Submit a request to help.sanai@gmail.com with subject line "Slay Account Deletion"

Upon receiving your deletion request, we will:
• Remove your authentication data from Firebase
• Cancel any active subscriptions
• Delete any associated account information

Note: Since personal data is stored only on your device, uninstalling the app immediately removes all goal and habit information.

Third-Party Services
We use the following services with minimal data sharing:

**Firebase Authentication** (for login and account management)
**Google Gemini API** (for AI features - processes data without storage)
**Payment processors** (RevenueCat, Apple App Store and Google Play Store for subscriptions)
**Firebase Analytics** (for app performance monitoring)

These services have their own privacy policies and handle only the minimum data required for their functions.

Content and Age Disclaimer
Slay provides motivational content with varying levels of directness and brutal honesty. While designed to be helpful and motivational, some content may be considered mature or intense. We:

• Do not provide professional life coaching services
• Do not guarantee specific results or outcomes
• Recommend consulting professional counselors for serious mental health concerns
• Use AI-generated content that may not always be appropriate for all situations

Children's Privacy
Slay is intended for users 17+ due to mature content and brutal honesty features. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.
